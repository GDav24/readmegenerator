## Description: 
his weeks challenge had me create a README generator program that allows the user to create a README.md file from their command line. The user inputs several prompts that ask the user about the description, installation, usage, contribution guidelines, test instructions, and test instructions. The user is also asked for a license type using a checkbox and a github username. The program compiles the data and creates a professional README.md file with user input. This README was created using the README generator program.
